title: MySo Clients
---

The MySo TypeScript SDK provides multiple client implementations for interacting with the MySo
network. Each client connects to a different API but provides two levels of access:

- **Native API** - Full access to everything the underlying API offers
- **[Core API](/myso/clients/core)** - A consistent interface across all clients for common
  operations

## Available Clients

| Client                                                 | API                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [MySoGrpcClient](/myso/clients/grpc) (recommended)       | [Full Node gRPC](https://docs.mysocial.network/references/fullnode-protocol) |
| [MySoGraphQLClient](/myso/clients/graphql)               | [GraphQL](https://docs.mysocial.network/references/myso-graphql)              |
| [MySoJsonRpcClient](/myso/clients/json-rpc) (deprecated) | [JSON-RPC (deprecated)](https://docs.mysocial.network/myso-api-ref)           |

All clients are compatible with Mysten SDKs like `@socialproof/file-storage` and `@socialproof/mydata`.

For most application gRPC is a good default. The JSON RPC API has been deprecated and will be
decommissioned soon. The GraphQL can be used for more advanced query patterns that can not be
supported directly on full nodes (eg, querying for transactions or events with various filters).

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { MySoGrpcClient } from '@socialproof/myso/grpc';

const client = new MySoGrpcClient({
	network: 'mainnet',
	baseUrl: 'https://fullnode.mainnet.mysocial.network:443',
});

// Use the native API for full access to transport-specific features
const { response } = await client.ledgerService.getTransaction({ digest: '0x...' });

// Use the Core API for transport-agnostic operations
const { object } = await client.core.getObject({ objectId: '0x...' });
```

## Native vs Core API

### Native API

Each client exposes the full capabilities of its underlying transport. Use the native API when you
need transport-specific features or want maximum control:

```typescript
import { MySoGrpcClient } from '@socialproof/myso/grpc';
import { MySoGraphQLClient } from '@socialproof/myso/graphql';
import { graphql } from '@socialproof/myso/graphql/schema';
import { MySoJsonRpcClient } from '@socialproof/myso/jsonRpc';

// gRPC - access various service clients to call any gRPC method
const { response } = await grpcClient.stateService.listOwnedObjects({ owner: '0x...' });

// GraphQL - write type-safe custom queries using the graphql function
const result = await graphqlClient.query({
	query: graphql(`
		query {
			chainIdentifier
		}
	`),
});

// JSON-RPC - call any JSON-RPC method
const coins = await jsonRpcClient.getCoins({ owner: '0x...' });
```

### Core API

All clients also implement the [Core API](/myso/clients/core) through `client.core`. This provides a
consistent interface for common operations that works identically across all transports:

```typescript
// These methods work the same on any client
const { object } = await client.core.getObject({ objectId: '0x...' });
const balance = await client.core.getBalance({ owner: '0x...' });
await client.core.executeTransaction({ transaction, signatures });
```

The Core API is essential for [building SDKs](/myso/sdk-building) that work with any client the user
chooses.

## Client Extensions

All clients support extensions through the `$extend` method, enabling SDKs like
[@socialproof/file-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialproof/file-storage) to add functionality:

```typescript
import { file-storage } from '@socialproof/file-storage';

const client = new MySoGrpcClient({ network: 'mainnet', baseUrl: '...' }).$extend(file-storage());

await client.file-storage.writeBlob({ ... });
```

See [Building SDKs](/myso/sdk-building) for more on creating client extensions.
