title: Faucet
---

Devnet, Testnet, and local networks include faucets that mint MYSO. You can use the MySo TypeScript
SDK to call a network's faucet and provide MYSO to the address you provide.

To request MYSO from a faucet, import the `requestMySoFromFaucetV2` function from the
`@socialproof/myso/faucet` package to your project.

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestMySoFromFaucetV2 } from '@socialproof/myso/faucet';
```

Use `requestMySoFromFaucetV2` in your TypeScript code to request MYSO from the network's faucet.

```typescript
await requestMySoFromFaucetV2({
	host: getFaucetHost('testnet'),
	recipient: <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>,
});
```

<Callout type="info">
	Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
	the limit and must wait to successfully run it again. For testnet, the best way to get MYSO is via
	the Web UI: `faucet.mysocial.network`.
