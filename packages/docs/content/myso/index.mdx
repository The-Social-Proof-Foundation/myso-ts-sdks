title: MySo TypeScript SDK Quick Start
---

The MySo TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the MySo blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a MySo or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @socialproof/myso
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for MySo networks.

| Network | Full node                             | faucet                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| local   | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (default)     | `http://127.0.0.1:9123/v2/gas` (default) |
| Devnet  | `https://fullnode.devnet.mysocial.network:443`  | `https://faucet.devnet.mysocial.network/v2/gas`    |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.mysocial.network:443` | `https://faucet.testnet.mysocial.network/v2/gas`   |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.mysocial.network:443` | `null`                                   |

<Callout type="warn">

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public
endpoints maintained by Mysten Labs (`fullnode.<NETWORK>.mysocial.network:443`) are rate-limited, and support
only 100 requests per 30 seconds or so. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with
high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider
(preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers
for MySo on the [MySo Dev Portal](https://mysocial.network/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tab.
