title: Install MySo TypeScript SDK
---

The MySo TypeScript SDK is available in the
[MySo TS SDK monorepo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks) and NPM.

## Install from NPM

To use the MySo TypeScript SDK in your project, run the following command in your project root:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @socialproof/myso
```

The SDK is published as an ESM only package. Make sure your `package.json` includes
`"type": "module"`:

```json
{
	"type": "module"
}
```

If you are using TypeScript, your `tsconfig.json` should use a compatible `moduleResolution` setting
such as `"NodeNext"`, `"Node16"`, or `"Bundler"`. See the
[2.0 migration guide](/myso/migrations/myso-2.0#esm-migration) for more details.

## Experimental tag for use with a local MySo network

Projects developing against one of the on-chain MySo networks (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet) should use
the base SDK published in the NPM registry (previous section) because the code aligns with the
relevant JSON-RPC. If your developing against a
[local network](https://docs.mysocial.network/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) built from the
`main` branch of the MySo monorepo, however, you should use the `experimental`-tagged SDK package as
it contains the latest features (or a local build detailed in the section that follows).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @socialproof/myso@experimental
```

## Install from local build

To build the SDK from the MySo monorepo, you must use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). With pnpm installed,
run the following command from the `myso` root directory:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
# Run the build for the TypeScript SDK
pnpm sdk build
```

With the SDK built, you can import the library from your `myso` project. To do so, use a path to the
`ts-sdks/packages/myso` directory that is relative to your project. For example, if you created a
folder `my-myso-project` at the same level as `myso`, use the following to import the locally built
MySo TypeScript package:

```bash
pnpm add ../ts-sdks/packages/myso
```
